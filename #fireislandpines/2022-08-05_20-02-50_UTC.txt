Tonight at @thepinesfireisland PAVILION for @wolfpuppresents JOCKSTRAP. Celebrating Birthday Host @stevestrates. 

I have been looking forward to tonight all summer, and now that it is here I feel very prepared to give the sound you need and I want to give. Being able to see so many dear people in my life the last few days has given me everything I need to do this properly. This week marks what would have been the 60th birthday of my drag mother, Bambi Kira. Tonight’s set is dedicated to her and all the fierce queens that have taught me everything I know. 

Thank you @michaelmacneal for believing in my sound from the start and this opportunity. I know we are going to have a great night. 🐕

House Music All Life Long. 🔊😸🔊
