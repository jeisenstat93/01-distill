Huge congratulations to @jaketribus, who just last month performed in not one, but two captivating pieces at Fire Island Dance Festival. This week, he's been named a Princess Grace Award recipient, one of the highest dance honors, which identifies and elevates emerging talent. What a thrill to see another @dradance community member recognized and we can't wait to see him onstage again soon. ðŸŽ‰
