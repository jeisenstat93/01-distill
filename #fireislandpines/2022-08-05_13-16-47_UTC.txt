A HUGE congrats to @imanlecaire, founder of @trans_asylias, for advocating to get a park on Fire Island honoring Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Please follow her work and support if you can.

Trans Asylias is an international mutual aid relief effort to assist trans individuals to find refuge and ultimately asylum in countries where transphobic policies threaten their dignity and lives.
