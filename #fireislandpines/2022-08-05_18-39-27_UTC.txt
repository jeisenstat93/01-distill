Stop down at the Sayville Farmers Market tomorrow, Saturday, August 6th, to check out our great vendors!

To all of our "western" Patrons, be aware that the Sayville Summerfest is occurring this weekend, so Main Street in Sayville will be closed to vehicular traffic all day.  Please visit the Market by taking Sunrise Hwy to Broadway Avenue south.
