Welcome! 

The digital world is saturated with data. Websites, social media platforms, and applications track what we do and produce [digital traces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuSWQN7uYhk). These traces have proven useful for social scientists interested in researching online communication and behavior. But, working with this data can be challenging both ethically and technically. 

This class will introduce you to a field that has come to be known as computational social science. In addition to debating the ethics of quantitative digital methods, you will have the opportunity to practice these methods during hands-on lab sessions. You will also learn to code in the R Programming Language, a skill that will serve you well at work and in future research endeavors.
