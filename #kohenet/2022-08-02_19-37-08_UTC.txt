Guess it’s time about time to reintroduce myself.

Hi! I’m Ketzirah - Gen-X (48), INTJ, Di, E-5, Manifesting Generator, Virgo ☀️ Libra 🌛 Leo 📈, Ravenclaw.

I’m a maker and teacher of the sacred arts, Kohenet, golem-maker, fiber artist, Mussar-nik, and a recovering corporate priestess. 

My work, through Devotaj Sacred Arts, is Jewishly-rooted divination, craftwork, and ceremony to connect past, present, and possible future(s).

I spend three days a week working in the Devotaj Sacred Arts studio and three as a marketing/communications strategist for a large advertising agency.

On Shabbat you can usually find me at Kohenet community services, which are open to the public (and then out for a hike or at a pub).

If you’ve been around the Jewitch community long enough you might remember me by the names wiredwitch, Carly, Chava Chai, or even Veruna Wyn — or remember the blog Peelapom.com, which I wrote from 2003-2013. 

Among the many teachers I’ve had over the years are Rav Kohenet Jill Hammer, Taya Ma, & Shoshana Jedwab as well as magickal teachers such as @angela.raincatcher, Katrina Messenger, @joannapcolbert, and @ivodominguezjr. 

In 2009, I was ordained as a Kohenet and also received ordination as a Celebrant of Becoming (a community I co-lead in Washington DC for about 10 years). 

When I’m not working or crafting, I love to read/watch SciFi, speculative fiction, and urban fantasy. I’m a long time comic book nerd, Marvel over DC — but Image and some others over Marvel. I do a lot of light hiking, play pinball, and love to bake. 

I grew up in MA, went to University of Miami, and now live in Washington, DC with my husband (@langdonwood), a variety of enchanted appliances, ensouled teddy bears, and a shretelekh (Yiddish for house elf).

So that’s me. 

AMA time I guess? 
Ask away!
