Av begins at sundown Thurs 7/28/2022⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I call Av the moon of Endings and Beginnings, and you can find so much more about the month Av at devotaj.com (or see the profile link). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Rosh Chodesh Av falls in the three-week period of time traditionally known as bein ha-metzarim (בֵּין הַמְּצָרִים), which means “between the straits.” This is the time when tradition tells us that both the first and second Temples fell. 

The holiday of Tisha B’Av (9th of Av) is the focal point of the month’s devastation holding five different biblical-era and talmudic-era tragedies, along with several modern-era tragedies.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But how can we move from such overwhelming tragedy to new life? The answer is through the path of the Maiden (Na'arah), as often it is the young ones in our lives that ensure that life goes on. The transformation begins on Tu B’Av, only a few days after Tisha B’Av.

Through connecting Tisha b'Av and Tu b'Av we find the courage to heal. We find the strength to heal and rejoice with the Maiden, even when things are at their worst.⠀⠀
