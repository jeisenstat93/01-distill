My mom used to say this all the time, even when we ate bread and butter. Even when everything fell apart. She said it with a fierce knowing. 

I think that every generation is here to amplify and live more fully into the promises our ancestors held. That manifested based on their capacities and realities. 

So now as I release the old, the survival, the small. Shifting into inhabiting a fully expressed essence and expansion/ascension I amplify the words that anchored my childhood-

Psalm 37:25-I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
