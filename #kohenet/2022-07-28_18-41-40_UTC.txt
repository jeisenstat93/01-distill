I call Av, "the moon of beginnings and endings" because it is the time we honor the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) and other tragedies, and the many times the we have rebuilt again.

Each month of the Jewish year is packed with rich correspondences for sacred arts and spiritual alignment/growth that lend themselves towards an energetic naming of the moon energy.

Historically a lot of the correspondences like Hebrew letter and tribe are derived from the Sefer Yetzirah. 

I've also used my teacher Rav Kohenet Jill Hammer's elemental system for the seasons for ages. Check out her book "The Jewish Book of Days" (http://amzn.to/2gN0R61) for more on that. 

And of course the alignment of a Netivah (pathway of Divine Presence) as taught in Kohenet, to each month of the year is really important to me.⁠

Additional correspondences that I've added to my mix over the years are either derived from existing correspondences like those from the ancient text the Sefer Yetzirah or new ones I've discovered in collaboration with amazing folks like @bekahstarrart
