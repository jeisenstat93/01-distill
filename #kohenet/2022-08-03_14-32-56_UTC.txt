I am looking forward to 7 weeks of dancing, praying, teaching, learning, and alchemizing Jewish wisdom into usable Life-Force, in the Embodied Shmita Journey’s final offering for this Shmita year: 

REWILD:
Intimacy with Mystery

We begin just days after our tradition encourages us to dance with our broken-openness with the Divine Shekhina in the fields, on the Full Moon of Av. And for 7 weeks that follow, we fold in lessons from the year behind us, while flowering and fruiting forward towards the redemption of a new year to come. 🍯🍎

We have so much to learn when we leap towards the mystery. Let’s dance. 

Please join me in the Embodied Shmita Journey with my earth-loving priestesses @aliza.rivka and @miriams.wellness, of @shekhinaspace, in this very special journey of integration and preparation for the next 7 year cycle ahead. 🌾🌾🌾
