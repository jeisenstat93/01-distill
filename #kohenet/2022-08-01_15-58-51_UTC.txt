13 Netivot in 4 Suits
5of 13: Chachamah (Wise Woman)

“I am the Chachamah (חכמה), the Wise Woman. I bring teaching, storytelling, peacemaking and collective memory.  Find me in the teachings of past and future ancestors. Know me in what is written and in the choices we make. I am the embodiment of learned, earned, and utilized knowledge."

Vessel: Share Knowledge of Place, Time, Soul
The vessel of the Chachamah, is one who has learned and earned knowledge, and brings the perspective that only time can provide. She shares her wisdom to counsel and advise. She is a reminder to continue learning throughout our lives, share our knowledge, and honor the wisdom of our elders as guides of the sacred.

Offering: Learn and Teach Ancestral Wisdom
The teachings left for us by our ancestors of blood or spirit —— and our willingness to learn, pass on, and build upon our inherited teachings are the offerings of the Chachamah.  These offerings may appear in many forms, from ancient scrolls to modern apps. How can you both receive and build upon your ancestral wisdom?

Ally: Choose the Way with Care.
The crossroads is the place where knowledge is sought and applied, and decisions must be made. One way of saying "crossroads'' in Hebrew is parshat derachim (פרשת דרכים). Parshat (sometimes parashat or parsha) is the word that is used to describe a specific section of the Torah, which tells us that every crossroads is a teacher of Torah. This ally embodies our ability to learn, discern, and make choices — moving us from knowledge to wisdom.

Gift: Find Courage to Expand Possibilities.
The gift of the Chachamah is courage, ometz lev (אמץ לב) in Hebrew. It takes courage to receive, share, and act with wisdom. Having a strong heart, which is the literal definition of ometz lev, means working through our fears and making choices that expand possibilities for not only ourselves, but also for others including the more than human world.
