Eht/Aht: a Netivot Wisdom Oracle (2nd Edition)
Coming in 5783 (aka 2023)

13 Netivot in 4 Suits
4 of 13: G'virah (Queen)

“I am the G’virah (גבירה), the Queen, and I bring leadership and protection. I am queen, matriarch, and warrior all in one.  When you summon the fullness of your power, I am here. I am the embodiment of strength, power, and the guardianship of both individuals and society.”

Vessel: Embrace the Fullness of Your Power
The G'virah is a woman who knows her power. She is strong, smart, and powerful — and that is beautiful. She takes care of herself and those in her sphere — and she is respected for that. She is a reminder to allow "She Who Dwells Within" to fill you and radiate out of you and to use that power to care for your people.

Offering: Exercise the Power from the Place of Spirit
The ancestral tent of the mothers is the offering of the G’virah. This may be a literal tent or just the place in your mind that not only connects you to Spirit but also creates a space for others to do the same? How do you create safe, welcoming spaces for your tribe?

Ally: Be Aligned, Clear, and Strong
The lioness doesn't question her purpose or power — she just knows. She is a reminder of our strength and responsibility.  She is the huntress and protectress. This ally embodies the purposeful power each of us inherently has if we choose to tap into it.

Gift: Utilize Your Resources Responsibly
The gift of the G’virah is responsibility, achrayut (אחריות) in Hebrew. A queen must know how to take responsibility for the lives, health, safety and well being of those in her sphere of influence - not just her own. She must also build community and support, because our spiritual and physical resources are only renewable if we tend them well.
