When sitting in this exchange, I really noticed myself dropping in and letting go, y'all. 

In our upcoming online Mystics Summit, you'll have an opportunity to explore Presence as Prayer: Coming Home to the Temple of Our Bodies.

Modern-day mystic and transformative ritual artist Taya Mâ Shere has a lot to offer. She speaks to the ancient art of prayer and, well, *demonstrates* the power of pulsing presence in body and spirit. 

Renowned for her radical spiritual leadership in Jewish communities and beyond, @tayatransforms shares perspectives from her own spiritual practice, offers insight into ancestral healing, and invites us to root in blessing as a path to contend with these turbulent times. Come home to embodied presence and emerge renewed.

In our exchange, you’ll:

* Learn about healing at the root of our spiritual traditions and how to reclaim these ancient practices to be relevant for the current time

* Reclaim prayer from distant cosmologies toward an alive practice rooted in our bodies, an awareness of right pace, and devotion to pleasure

* Engage a deeper understanding of the Jewish concepts of the here and now, the present moment.

If this sounds compelling to you, please RSVP for the Mystics Summit (link in bio) — there's no charge to catch the dialogues as they air, August 8-12.
