The TIME has come my sweet ones to spiral once more. 

The New Moon Collective for the 5783 year is now open so claim your spot babes! 

This year there is space for 20 circle members - 
If you have been in circle before and want to re-join message me to get on top of waitlist! 

If you’ve never been in a new moon circle with me before I can promise you this:
You will be moved spiritually and emotionally, you’ll learn so much about yourself in relationship to space and time and the Jewish Lunar Calendar. You’ll witness yourself in your growth and change throughout this coming year in a way you have never noticed before and you will fall deeply and madly in love with the spiraling of the moon as she cycles and spirals us into sweet embrace. 

Details + testimonials in post, just click through. More abundant details located on my website.

Feel the bliss every month with me and a community of incredible women! 

We begin our 5783 circle on September 22 at 7:15p Eastern

Beyond blessed and blissed to curate this sacred virtual space and cannot believe it’s time for another spiraling. 

Dm with questions if you have and I cannot wait to circle with you.
