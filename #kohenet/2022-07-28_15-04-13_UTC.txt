We are delighted to announce our newest offering in the Virtual Temple: A Call to Coherence: Cultivating Trauma-Aware Ritual with Rav Kohenet Taya Mâ Shere. 
. 
How do the needs and reverberations of ritual shift in response to experiences and impacts of trauma? How do we show up with skill and care when trauma is present inside of ourselves, ritual participants, and the traditions which the ritual roots? 
. 
A Call to Coherence offers blueprints, tools, and embodied practice for transforming trauma and lays pathways for crafting trauma-aware ritual. 
.
The six week journey will root in video calls with Taya Mâ (@tayatransforms), on Thursdays, Sept 1-Oct 6, from 4pm-515pm ET, and includes a discussion forum on Mighty Networks to integrate learning amongst participants. 
.
Registration is open! Please visit our LinkTr.ee or go to kohenet.org/coherence to read more and reserve your spot.
